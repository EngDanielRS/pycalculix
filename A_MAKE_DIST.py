"""
This file makes distributable packages in the zip file format
It deletes folders before making them, then does cleanup after it's done

Results:
    dist folder
        Has the pyalculix zip file one installs with pip
    examples folder
        Has the example py files only
    pycalculix
        Source code for the distribution, and binaries of gmsh and calculix
